💫 About Me

👋 Hi, I’m R Naveen Patil

🔐 Cybersecurity Engineer | 🤖 AI Enthusiast | ☁️ Cloud & 📱 App Developer

I build secure, intelligent, and scalable systems at the intersection of Cybersecurity, Artificial Intelligence, Cloud Computing, and Mobile App Development.
My focus is not just on building applications, but on building them right — secure by design, intelligent by default, and ready for real-world threats.

I believe strong security comes from understanding both sides of the system:
how it’s engineered and how it can be attacked.

🚀 What I Work On

I prefer projects with real-world impact, not just demos.

🌱 Currently Deepening My Skills

🛡️ Cybersecurity fundamentals (Networking, Linux, OS, Security concepts)

🧠 Deep Learning, Computer Vision & NLP

☁️ Cloud security & distributed systems

⚙️ AI integration in Android & Flutter apps

🔍 Secure coding practices & vulnerability research

🤝 Open to Collaboration

I’m open to collaborating on:

⚡ Fun Fact

I don’t just learn how systems work —
I learn how they fail, break, and get exploited.
That’s how you actually build secure software.
